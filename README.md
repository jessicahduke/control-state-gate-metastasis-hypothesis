Conceptual hypothesis proposing that metastatic progression across cancers may require a prior whole-organism control-state transition involving distributed nervous-system regulation and loss of adaptive physiological flexibility
Metastasis as a Systems-Level Phase Transition in Organismal Control
Abstract
This document presents a conceptual framework proposing that the transition to lethal cancer may represent a systems-level phase transition in organismal control, rather than solely the endpoint of cumulative cellular mutation. The hypothesis suggests that metastatic permissiveness emerges from distributed regulatory changes involving neural and neuro-immune coordination.
Core Hypothesis: Leadership Inversion
Metastatic progression is proposed to involve a shift in regulatory authority within the body’s distributed control networks, in which tumor-associated signaling interacts with and potentially subverts neural and neuro-immune regulatory processes, resulting in reduced adaptive physiological flexibility and systemic permissiveness for dissemination.
Causal Reversibility Predictions
If the hypothesis is correct, interventions that stabilize distributed neural coordination and restore adaptive control flexibility would be expected to reduce:
Dissemination biomarkers
Recurrence rates
Metastatic progression
independent of direct tumor cytotoxicity.
Falsifiability Criteria
The hypothesis would be weakened or disproven if:
Metastasis routinely occurs without detectable control-state transitions.
Lethal tumors demonstrate no neural or neuro-immune remodeling signatures.
Restoration of control flexibility fails to influence dissemination or survival outcomes.
Intellectual Origin: Integrative reasoning across systems control theory, distributed nervous-system physiology, and observed timing of metastatic transition.
